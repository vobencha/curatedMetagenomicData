returned; if \code{TRUE}, relative abundance proportions are multiplied by read
depth and rounded to the nearest integer prior to being returned}

\description{
To access curated metagenomic data users will use \code{curatedMetagenomicData()},
after "shopping" the \link[=combined_metadata]{sample metadata} for studies they are
interested in. The \code{dryrun} argument allows users to perfect a query prior to
(down)loading a data set. When \code{dryrun = TRUE} and \code{print = TRUE}, the names
of matched data sets will be printed nicely before a character vector of
names is returned invisibly. When \code{dryrun = TRUE} and \code{print = FALSE}, only
the invisible character vector of names is returned. The later behavior is
useful in the context of \link[base:lapply]{lapply} and \link[purrr:map]{map}
functions to (down)load multiple data sets without messages. When
\code{dryrun = FALSE}, a (sparse) matrix is (down)loaded and used to construct a
\link[SummarizedExperiment:SummarizedExperiment-class]{SummarizedExperiment}
object with corresponding metadata from \link[=combined_metadata]{sample metadata}.
If there is more than one date corresponding to the data set, the more recent
one is selected automatically. Finally, if a \code{relative_abundance} data set is
requested with \code{counts = TRUE}, relative abundance proportions will be
multiplied by read depth (i.e. \code{number_reads}) and rounded to the nearest
integer prior to being returned as a
\link[SummarizedExperiment:SummarizedExperiment-class]{SummarizedExperiment}
object with corresponding metadata from \link[=combined_metadata]{sample metadata}.
